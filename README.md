# CambridgeDictionary :book::books:
A simple and consistent lib to query the meaning of words in the [Cambridge dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/).


# Dependencies
[ScrapySharp](https://github.com/rflechner/ScrapySharp)


# Features I mind implement
- [x] Meanings
- [x] Similar words sugestion
- [x] Phonetics


As I had implemented all the basics features but I'm going to enhance the results, performance, and documentation in the next few days.

# Next Steps
 - [x] Release alfa version
 - [ ] Add method GetMeaningFromHtmlSource the avoid requests
 - [ ] Enhence Console Application to create and read \[word\].txt files with the source of the web pages the avoid requests
 - [ ] Setup a simple CI/CD mechanism on Github - (It's only building when something is pushed to master branch at the moment)
 - [ ] Unit Tests


# Nuget
The lib is finally available on Nuget: https://www.nuget.org/packages/MrBroccoli.CambridgeDictionary.Cli.


# Setup

## DI

You can setup the lib in your DI container as follow and then pass the ```ICambridgeDictionaryCli``` interface in the constructor of your services.

```C#
using CambridgeDictionary.Cli.Extensions;

...

serviceCollection.AddCambridgeDictionary();
```

```C#
using CambridgeDictionary.Cli;

...

public class Service {
    
    private readonly _cambridgeDictionaryCli;

    public YourService(ICambridgeDictionaryCli cambridgeDictionaryCli) {
        _cambridgeDictionaryCli = cambridgeDictionaryCli;
    }

    ...

}
```


## Without DI

It's just needed to import the lib and then create a new instance of the class ```CambridgeDictionaryCli```.

```C#
using CambridgeDictionary.Cli;

...

var cambridgeDictionary = new CambridgeDictionaryCli();
```


# Usage

Currently, the lib only has an method called GetMeaning:

````C#
/// <summary>
/// Search for entries of the word in dictionary
/// </summary>
/// <param name="word">The word to be searched.</param>
/// <returns>The information about the word on the dictionary</returns>
EntrySet GetEntry(string word);
````


# Return

A EntrySet looks like this:

```
EntrySet - Represts a set of entries of the searched word
{
    string Headword - Represents the searched word,
    [
        Entry - Represents an entry in dictionary
        {
